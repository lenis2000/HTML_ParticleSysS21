We start by taking a bijection of lozenge tilings with nonintersecting lattice paths.

There are five local configurations of paths at a vertex. We call them $a_1,b_1,c_1,b_2,c_2$.

Thus, we can generalize the lozenge model to a following stat-mech model with Boltzmann weights:

Here $Z$ is the partition function, which in the particular case reduces to the MacMahon's triple product:

Now we introduce a complication and allow for one more vertex type, $a_2$.

This leads to pictures which are no longer interpretable as lozenge tilings.

This model is called the **six vertex model**

The six vertex model has a very interesting history in physics and mathematics. I will not attempt to survey it, see the lecture notes mentioned in the [[_Lecture 15, 3-24#Notes and references|refs]].

One of the most important boundary conditions in the six vertex model is the **domain wall boundary condition**:

There is a determinantal formula for the partition function. This formula is much more complicated than the explicit products we saw for lozenge tilings.

There is a particular case when the determinant simplifies, $a_1=a_2=b_1=b_2=c_1=c_2=1$:
