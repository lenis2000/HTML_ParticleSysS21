Within particle systems, a particular subfamily of six vertex models is much easier to study. These are the **stochastic six vertex models**.

In this case, by making endpoints of our paths free, we can sample the stochastic six vertex model by just running a Markov chain.

And the partition function becomes simply equal to 1.

So, we consider the **half-domain wall boundary condition**:
