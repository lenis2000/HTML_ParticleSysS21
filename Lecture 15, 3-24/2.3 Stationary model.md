We can contruct a stationary version of the stochastic six vertex model.

#### Theorem 2.3.1

As it is not too clear which arrow jumps first, we need to explain what is the dynamics. In other words, we construct the stationary model.

#### Lemma 2.3.2

If $(1-b_2)\alpha(1-\beta)=(1-b_1)\beta(1-\alpha)$, then having independent Bernoulli inputs from below and from the left, the vertex model's output produces independent Bernoulli outputs with the same distributions.

#### Proof 2.3.1

Lemma proves that Bernoulli distributions at the horizontal and vertical pieces lead to a compatible family of measures on quadrants which can be made going to $-\infty$.
