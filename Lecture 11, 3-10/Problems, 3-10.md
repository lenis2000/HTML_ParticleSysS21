# 1

1. Show that the expectation

is finite for arbitrary $q\in \mathbb{C}$.

2. When the above Schur measure is replaced by a general one $SM_{(\vec x,\vec y)}$, show that the same expectaton exists for $|q|<1$.

# 2

1. Prove [[3.2 Oscillatory integrals#Proposition 3 2 1|Proposition 3.2.1]]. 
2. Compute the polynomial factor $\mathrm{Poly}(N)$ in this proposition, assuming for simplicity that $f(x)$ has a unique global maximum. You will see that the factor $\mathrm{Poly}(N)$ in fact goes to zero and does not even grow.

# 3

1. Justify the location of the contours $\mathop{\mathrm{Re}}S(z)=\mathop{\mathrm{Re}}S(z_c)$ separating the blue and the white regions in [[3.3 Double integrals and asymptotics of the density. Complex conjugate case#Contour configuration 1|this figure]], in the case when $(\sqrt \tau-1)^2<\chi<(\sqrt \tau+1)^2$.

2. Show that the contours $z,w$ in the double integral can be moved, without crossing any poles except $w=z$, to the new locations in [[3.3 Double integrals and asymptotics of the density. Complex conjugate case#Contour configuration 2|this figure]]
