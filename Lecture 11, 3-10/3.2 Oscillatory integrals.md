In the regime as $x,t,N$ proportionally go to infinity, the three components under the integral, 
$$
(z/w)^x,\qquad ( (w-1)/(z-1))^N,\qquad  e^{t(w-z)}
$$
generically explode or decay to zero exponentially fast. 

Indeed, as $N\to\infty$,
$$
\left( |z|e^{i \varphi} \right)^N=|z|^N e^{i N\varphi}\to
\begin{cases}
	\infty,&|z|>1;\\
	0,&|z|<1,
\end{cases}
$$
and when $|z|=1$, the behavior is purely oscillatory.

Therefore, for a nontrivial asymptotics we need to find the right balance between all the components.

Let us consider a simpler case of a single integral.

#### Proposition 3.2.1. Stationary phase / Laplace method

For $f$ smooth, bounded, $\mathbb{C}-valued$, and with finitely many global maxima, we have the following asymptotics as $N\to\infty$:
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}e^{N f(x)}dx\sim
\mathrm{Poly}(N)\cdot \exp\{N\cdot \max_{x\in \mathbb{R}}\mathrm{Re}\,f(x)\},
$$
where $\mathrm{Poly}(N)$ is some factor which grows at most polynomially.

#### Proof 3.2.1

See [[Problems, 3-10#2|Problem 2]].


We will apply the idea of this result to double oscillating integrals (like we see in the density function). This is usually referred to as a saddle point / steepest descent method.
