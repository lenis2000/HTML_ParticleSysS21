Now we can employ the second integration, now over $q$, to extract the coefficients by any fixed power of $q$. This produces the *density function*:

#### Proposition 2.2.1

This is a double integral:

#### Proof 2.2.1

This is straightforward, by interchanging integration over $q$ and expectation. Since the $q$ integration contour is around $0$, we can make $|q|$ small, so there are no convergence issues.


#### Example 2.2.2. Notation for density

We denote for any $x\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge0}$:
