Let us set $t=N\tau$, $x=\lfloor N\chi \rfloor$, and let $N\to\infty$. Here $\tau,\chi\ge0$ are the scaled time and space, respectively.

Then, the integrand in $r_{N,t}(x)$ given by [[3.1 Change of variables#Proposition 3 1 1|Proposition 3.1.1]] takes the form
$$
\frac{1}{w(w-z)}
\exp
\left[ N\left\{ \frac{\lfloor \chi N \rfloor }{N}(\log z-\log w)+\log(w-1)-\log(z-1)+
\tau(w-z)\right\} \right].
$$
The quantity $\frac{\lfloor \chi N \rfloor }{N}$ can be replaced by $\chi$, as asymptotically this is irrelevant (on the scale we're working at).

#### Definition 3.3.1

Define the function 
$$
S(w):=-\chi \log w+\log (w-1)+\tau w.
$$

#### Remark 3.3.2

Any branches of the logarithms work, as we're taking their exponents or will be working with their real parts and derivatives. All these operations do not depend on the branch.

So, we have

Let us study the asymptotics of the integrand $e^{N(S(w)-S(z))}$, which is dictated by looking at maxima and minima of $\mathop{\mathrm{Re}}S(z)$, along the contours.

Here is an example of a surface $\mathop{\mathrm{Re}}S(z)$, for some particular $\tau,\chi$.

![[../img/Pasted image 20210310213819.png]]

The $w$ and $z$ contours are drawn. 

Clearly, for this configuration of the contours, we have $\mathop{\mathrm{Re}}S(w)-\mathop{\mathrm{Re}}S(z)>0$ for $z,w$ on the contours, which suggests that the density might be going to infinity. 

In fact, this is not the case. One reason for this is that the density is always between zero and one. Another reason is that while the integral of the absolute value might be large, the signs present in the integrand might lead to cancellation of exponentially large terms.

So, our goal is to move the $w$ contour to minimize $\mathop{\mathrm{Re}}S(w)$, and move the $z$ contour to maximize $\mathop{\mathrm{Re}}S(z)$. At the same time, the contours cannot cross $0$ and $1$ (but might cross each other; possibly at a cost of picking residues).

Let us show how to place the integration contours so that to see the asymptotics of the integral. Let us look for saddle points of $\mathop{\mathrm{Re}}S(z)$, which are the same as the critical points of $S(z)$:

![[../img/Pasted image 20210310214709.png]]

In the above picture $D<0$, which corresponds to two complex conjugate saddles $z_c,\bar z_c$ (where $z_c$ is in the upper half plane), and clearly $\mathop{\mathrm{Re}}S(z_c)=\mathop{\mathrm{Re}}S(\bar z_c)$.

In this piece we consider only the case $D<0$.

#### Definition 3.3.3

Let the region $\mathcal{L}$ be the $(\tau,\chi)$ region in which $D<0$. This is readily seen to be 
$$
(\sqrt \tau-1)^2<\chi<(\sqrt \tau+1)^2.
$$

---

In $\mathcal{L}$, the region where $\mathop{\mathrm{Re}}(S(z)-S(z_c))>0$ looks as follows:


###### Contour configuration 1

![[../img/Pasted image 20210310215039.png]]

Here the old contours $z,w$ are also given.

Let us move the $z,w$ contours to the new position as follows:

###### Contour configuration 2

![[../img/Pasted image 20210310215312.png]]

On the new contours we have $\mathop{\mathrm{Re}}\left( S(w)-S(z) \right)\le 0$, and via a little careful analysis one can show that the double contour integral over these new contours goes to zero. 

---

However, it is not true that $r_{N,t}(x)$ equals this double contour integral over the new contours which goes to zero. Indeed, in the process of moving the contours, we cross the pole at $z=w$, which leads to a residue:

![[../img/Pasted image 20210310215435.png]]

The residue at $w=z$ is simply equal to $1/z$, see [[3.1 Change of variables#Proposition 3 1 1|Proposition 3.1.1]].

Putting this all together, we have proven the following result:

#### Theorem 3.3.4

In the regime $t=\tau N$, $x=\lfloor \chi N \rfloor$ and $N\to+\infty$, where $(\tau,\chi)\in \mathcal{L}$ (i.e., $(\sqrt \tau-1)^2<\chi<(\sqrt \tau+1)^2$), the density function of the Schur measure $SM_{(1,\ldots,1;\rho_t )}$ converges to:
$$
r_\tau(\chi)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\bar z_c(\tau,\chi)}^{z_c(\tau,\chi)}\frac{dz}{z},
$$
where the integration contour from $\bar z_c$ to $z_c$ crosses the real line to the right of $0$.
