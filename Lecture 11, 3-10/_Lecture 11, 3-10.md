This does not finish the proof of TASEP's limit shape, which will be continued in [[../Lecture 12, 3-15/_Lecture 12, 3-15|Lecture 12]]. There are two things remaining:
1. Complete the analysis of the double contour integral in the case when there are two real saddle points (instead of two complex conjugate)
2. Recover the TASEP limit shape parabola from these computations.

# Notes and references

1. The approach of Schur measure asymptotics via contour integrals is pioneered by Okounkov in ```Symmetric functions and random partitions``` (2003), [arXiv:math/0309074 \[math.CO\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0309074), section 3.
2. Another approach to the same asymptotic analysis goes via orthogonal polynomials and their associated difference operators, [arXiv:math/0610240 \[math.PR\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0610240)
3. The use of difference operators to extract density follows the Macdonald processes work ([arXiv:1111.4408 \[math.PR\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.4408)), see also [arXiv:1310.8007 \[math.PR\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.8007)
