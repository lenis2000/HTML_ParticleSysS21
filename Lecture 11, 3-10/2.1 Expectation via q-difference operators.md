Now we use the $q$-difference operators $D_q^{(x)}$ in the variables $x_1,\ldots,x_N$, to extract observables of Schur measures.

Recall:

#### Proposition 2.1.1

#### Proof 2.1.1

This is straightforward - we can apply the operator under the summation over $\lambda$. We assume that $|q|<1$, so that the series with the $q$-dependent prefactor converges.

#### Proposition 2.1.2

The action of the $q$-difference operator has a form of a contour integral:

#### Proof 2.1.2

Let us take the integral and evaluate it as a sum of residues at all $z=x_i$. We have

The last product over $1\le j\le M$ is

We see that this completely matches the action of $D_q^{(x)}$. $\square$
