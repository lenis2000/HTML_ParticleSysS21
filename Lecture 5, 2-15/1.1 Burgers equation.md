#### Application to step initial condition

![[../img/Pasted image 20210215204827.png]]

At $t=0$, the density is not differentiable at $0$. However, $\rho(t,x)=\frac{1}{2}-\frac{x}{2t}$ has pointwise limit to the step function $\rho(0,x)$ as $t\to 0$ (for all $x\ne 0$).

The Burgers equation with this initial condition does not have a unique solution. To select this particular $\rho(t,x)$, additional conditions are needed, such as conservation of particles, or "entropy" solution requirement.
