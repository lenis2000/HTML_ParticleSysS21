#### Definition 2.1.1. Basic coupling

Having 2 TASEPs $\eta_t$ and $\zeta_t$ on $\mathbb{Z}$, we couple them into a single process $(\eta_t,\zeta_t)$, such that the processes use the same exponential clocks attached to vertices of $\mathbb{Z}$. In particular, once two particles glue:

then they stay glued together forever

#### Definition 2.1.3. Ordering of measures

We say that $\mu_1\le \mu_2$ if there exists a probability measure on $\left\{ 0,1 \right\}^{\mathbb{Z}}\times \left\{ 0,1 \right\}^{\mathbb{Z}}$ with marginals $\mu_1,\mu_2$, under which $\eta\le \zeta$ with probability one (where $(\eta,\zeta)$ is the configuration on $\mathbb{Z}\sqcup \mathbb{Z}$).

We refer to a measure with prescribed marginals as a "coupling".

The proof is straightforward.
