1. The proof that all extreme stationary translation invariant measures for the TASEP are the Bernoulli product measures is given in ```Liggett, Thomas M. Coupling the Simple Exclusion Process. Ann. Probab. 4 (1976), no. 3, 339--356```. [doi:10.1214/aop/1176996084](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aop/1176996084). We follow this paper in our proof.
2. Construction of the stationary stochastic six vertex model is described in ```Amol Aggarwal. Current fluctuations of the stationary ASEP and six-vertex model. Duke Math. J., Volume 167, Number 2 (2018), 269-384,``` [https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04726](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04726), Lemma A.2.
