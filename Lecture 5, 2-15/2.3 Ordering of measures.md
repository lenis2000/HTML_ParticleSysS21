It suffices to check that:

This is where I am omitting some smaller details, and refer to Lemmas 2.4, 2.5, and 3.1 in Liggett's 1976 paper (see [[_Lecture 5, 2-15#Notes and references|references]]). In broad terms, that these configurations have zero probability makes sense because $\nu$ is stationary. Each of these configurations has a nonzero chance of gluing the particles together (to a state $(0,1)$), and because $\nu$ is stationary, this gluing should have already happened.

##### Step 4

So, for a pair of extreme, translation invariant, stationary measures $\mu_1,\mu_2$ we have constructed a coupling $\nu$ which is itself extreme, translation invariant, stationary for the coupled process. Moreover, we have shown that 
$$
\nu\left( \zeta\le\eta\ \text{or} \ \zeta\ge \eta \right)=1,
$$
which means that $\mu_1\le \mu_2$ or $\mu_1\ge \mu_2$. This proves the proposition.

#### Remark 2.3.2

The above proposition means that the extreme, translation invariant, stationary measures form a totally ordered set, which suggests that they are indeed indexed by a single parameter.
