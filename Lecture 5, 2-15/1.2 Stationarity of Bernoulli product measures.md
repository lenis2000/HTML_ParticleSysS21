#### Definition 1.2.1

Let $Ber(\rho)$ denote the Bernoulli product measure on $\left\{ 0,1 \right\}^{\mathbb{Z}}$.

#### Proposition 1.2.2

For each $\rho\in[0,1]$, the measure $Ber(\rho)$ is stationary under the TASEP evolution.

#### Remark 1.2.5

In fact, [[#Lemma 1 2 3 Single site|Lemma 1.2.3]] is not necessary, and we discussed it just for an illustration.

#### Proof 1.2.4

We prove this by induction on $n$. That is, it suffices to look at a single site.

#### Remark 1.2.6

This technique of constructing stationary processes works for most integrable systems, including stochastic six vertex model and random polymers.
