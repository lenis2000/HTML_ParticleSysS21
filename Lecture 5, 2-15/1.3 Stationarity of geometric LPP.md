In the last-passage percolation model with geometric weights, its stationary version (meaning in a sense the full-plane LPP) may be constructed by adding certain carefully selected boundary weights.

The stationarity of this model is checked in [[Problems, 2-15#1|Problem 1]] and [[Problems, 2-15#2|Problem 2]].
