For interacing particle systems, the large deviations are different on two sides of the law of large numbers. 

Consider TASEP:

We have $c=t/4$.

Then large deviations take the form:

Let us now look at large deviations for the stochastic six vertex model, using our formulas.

In the "too slow" regime, the convergence should be as

In the Fredholm determinant, we have $1$ as the first term, and the rest would be a correction of exponentially small size. 

**Remark.** In the "too fast" regime, the Fredholm determinant should converge to zero, which means that all integrals of all orders would nontrivially contribute. This is much harder to analyze.

When $\alpha<0$ ("too fast" regime), the two roots are complex conjugate. For the "too slow" regime,

However, in the "too fast" case,

and it is not clear what would be the end contribution.
