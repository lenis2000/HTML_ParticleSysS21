# Notes and references

There are several papers on the method of $t$- (or $q$-) moments in the analysis of interacting particle systems. Here are the main references:

2. Alexei Borodin, Ivan Corwin, Tomohiro Sasamoto. From duality to determinants for q-TASEP and ASEP. https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5035. Section 3
3. Alexei Borodin, Ivan Corwin, Leonid Petrov, Tomohiro Sasamoto. Spectral theory for the q-Boson particle system. https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.3475. Appendix 7.2 has the proof of the contour shift argument.
4. Alexey Bufetov, Matteo Mucciconi, Leonid Petrov. Yang-Baxter random fields and stochastic vertex models. https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06815. Section 9.1 discusses operator approach to getting $t$-moments of the stochastic six vertex model, and the corresponding Fredholm determinants.

Large deviations of particle systems have a long history, starting from TASEP in the 1990s:
1. Seppalainen, "Coupling the Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process with a Moving Interface" http://math-mprf.org/journal/articles/id830/.
2. Johansson, "Shape Fluctuations and Random Matrices" https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9903134.
3. For an approach explained in the lecture, but for ASEP, see also https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05806, section 3.
