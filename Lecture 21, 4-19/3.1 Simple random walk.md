Let us now talk briefly about large deviations in the stochastic six vertex model. We start from the simple random walk, as a warm up.

For it, we have the following law of large numbers and central limit theorem:

Large deviations are statements of the following form:

Sometimes, for more complicated models, even lim inf or lim sup type estimates are good enough. For the random walk we can compute everything explicitly:
