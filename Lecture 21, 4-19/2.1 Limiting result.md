We have shown that the asymptitcs
$$
\mathbb{E}\frac1{(-t^{h(Lx,Ly)+L\mathcal{H}(x,y)+r L^{1/3}};t)_\infty}
$$
gives $(1+O(L^{-1/3}))$ times the Fredholm determinant

Indeed, to see that this is the desired Fredholm determinant, we take the integrations and put them inside the determinants, using the so-called Andreief's identity (there is in fact $\ell!$ in the right-hand side):
