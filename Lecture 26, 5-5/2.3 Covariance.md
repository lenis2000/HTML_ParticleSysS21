Now let us get a formula for the covariance. This is not yet proving the Gaussian asymptotics, as for the Gaussian asymptotics one would have to show that all multipoint expectations / observables are expressed through the covariance in a certain specific form. We will omit the corresponding argument, and refer to the paper on stochastic telegraph equation for details.


First, we make the contours avoid the poles at $z_i=z_j$. This is possible for $t$ sufficiently close to $1$:

The extra transformation is possible because:

With the other contours, we can now take asymptotics:

This shows an explicit covariance.
