In symmetric systems, we also expect more classical Gaussian fluctuations, since they model "short-time" behaviour.

Consider the symmetric versions of ASEP and stochastic 6V model (i.e., with $t=1$).

That is, we did not put $t=1$ in the beginning, as that system would be harder to analyze. Rather, a limit $t\to1$ simultaneously with $b_1\to 1$ produces a Gaussian behaviour, which can be seen in particular using our $t$-moments.

A random sample of the model with $b_1,b_2$ close to 1 looks like this:
