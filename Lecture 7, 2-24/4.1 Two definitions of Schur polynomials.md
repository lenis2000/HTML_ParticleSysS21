#### Definition 4.1.1. Schur polynomial as a determinant

![[../img/Pasted image 20210225225932.png]]

This expression is clearly symmetric in the $x_i$'s. Moreover, it is a polynomial because the numerator is divisible by $x_i-x_j$, and the denominator is the Vandermonde determinant (see [[Problems, 2-24#1 Vandermonde determinant|Problem 1]]).

#### Definition 4.1.3. Schur polynomial as a sum

![[../img/Pasted image 20210225230414.png]]

This represents the Schur polynomial as a sum over interlacing arrays of depth $N$ with fixed top row $\lambda^{(N)}=\lambda$.

For example, for $N=2$ and $\lambda=(a,b)$, there are $a-b+1$ such arrays, and the formula is identical to the one in [[#Example 4 1 2]] above.

#### Theorem 4.1.4

Two definitions of Schur polynomials - [[[#Definition 4 1 1 Schur polynomial as a determinant|1]] and [[#Definition 4 1 3 Schur polynomial as a sum|2]] - are equivalent.

#### Corollary 4.1.5

The sum over interlacing arrays in [[#Definition 4 1 3 Schur polynomial as a sum|Definition 4.1.3]] is symmetric in the $x_i$'s.

#### Proof 4.1.5

It is informative to prove [[#Corollary 4 1 5]] independently of [[#Theorem 4 1 4]]. Graphically, let us swap $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$.

In combinatorics, this operation of flipping is known as the _Bender-Knuth involution_.
