Recall the push-block process:

#### Theorem 3.1.1

The push-block process preserves the class of Gibbs measures on interlacing arrays. Moreover, it preserves the class of extreme Gibbs measures. The action on the extreme Gibbs measures' parameters is as follows:
$$
\gamma^+\mapsto \gamma^++\text{time elapsed under the push-block process}
$$

We do not prove this theorem now, as it needs some Schur polynomials machinery. It might be proven using some intertwining of noncolliding Poisson random walks, but this intertwining also follows from the Schur polynomials machinery.

#### Example 3.1.2

Let us focus on one example which confirms the previous theorem in a particular case.

In general, to show the preservation of the class of Gibbs measures on interlacing arrays, we need:
