# 1. Vandermonde determinant

Show that
$$
\det\left[ x_i^{N-j} \right]_{i,j=1}^N=\prod_{1\le i<j\le N}(x_i-x_j).
$$

# 2

Show that to prove the branching rule for the Schur polynomials
$$
s_\lambda(x_1,\ldots,x_N )=
\sum_{\mu\colon\mu\prec\lambda}
s_\mu(x_1,\ldots,x_{N-1} )x_N^{|\lambda| -\mu},
$$
it suffices to show this for $x_N=1$.

Write $D_2$ as an explicit differential operator acting in the $x_i$'s, and compute its eigenvalues when acting on the Schur polynomials.
