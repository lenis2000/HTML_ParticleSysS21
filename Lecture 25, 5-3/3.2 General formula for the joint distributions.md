Let us now specify which data is required for multipoint observables of the coloured stochastic six vertex model.

The domain is between two down-right paths. 

The incoming colour configuration **must be increasing**, but colours can repeat. 

#### Definition 3.2.1

The initial data (down-right path Q and incoming colours) is encoded as follows:

#### Definition 3.2.2

#### Definition 3.2.3

The outgoing data is encoded by arbitrary points (along the down-right path P):

Also we specify, which coloured height functions are taken at these points. This is done by picking colours $0\le c_1\le c_2\le \ldots\le c_k$. Moreover, the assignment of colours to the points is arbitrary, so we need also to specify a permutation $\pi\in S_k$.

#### Definition 3.2.4. Observable

Consider the following random variable

#### Corollary 3.2.6

There are two easy cases:
