Recall that we're working with the coloured stochastic six vertex model:

In the previous lecture we proved the following theorem, based on the involution in the Hecke algebra:

#### Theorem 1.0.1

Here the probability of the same permutation $\sigma\in S_N$ is the same for the vertex model on both sides.

This theorem implies the following interpretation of the joint distribution of the coloured height function values at a single point $(M,N)$. Recall the definition:

#### Definition 1.0.2

The coloured height function is defined as

#### Corollary 1.0.3

There is the following equality in distribution between the coloured and the uncoloured models:
