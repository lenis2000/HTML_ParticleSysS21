Prove that the Demazure-Lusztig operators give rise to a representation of the Hecke algebra of $S_N$ in the space of rational functions in $w_1,\ldots,w_N$, in which the quadratic relation has the form
$$
(T_i-q)(T_i+1)=0,\qquad i=1,\ldots,N.

Prove [[2.1 Mapping to Hall-Littlewood processes#Lemma 2 1 1|Lemma 2.1.1]].

# 3

Write down the two "easy" particular cases of the general q-moment formula (see [[3.2 General formula for the joint distributions#Corollary 3 2 6|Corollary 3.2.6]]). Match these formulas together, and deduce from this the flip invariance:
