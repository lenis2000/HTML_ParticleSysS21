We begin by recalling the eigenoperators for the Hall-Littlewood polynomials.

The action of $\widetilde D$ on product functions takes a contour integral form

Our objective now is to compute Hall-Littlewood process expectations

or, equivalently,

#### Lemma 2.2.1

Let $\widetilde D_n$ be the operator applied in the variables $u_1,\ldots,u_n$. Then, expectations

are computed by applying

#### Proof 2.2.1

We display the proof in the particular case, but the general case is analogous.

These forms of the partition function $Z$ are useful for applications of various operators. In particular, we have

Therefore, the operator application leads to the following result. (We omit the contour integral manipulations that are the same as we did in the single-point case.)
