# 1 Joint distribution at a single point, recall

- [[1 Joint distribution in the coloured model at a single point]]

# 2 Computing the single-point observables

Here we prove a formula for the joint distribution of the coloured height functions at a single point, which is a slight extension of our analysis of the uncoloured stochastic six vertex model by means of difference operators.

- [[2.2 Contour integral via difference operators]]

# 3 Multipoint observables in the coloured model

Here we switch the notation to that of the Bufetov-Korotkikh paper, instead of rewriting their results for our notation. This leads to equivalent results. In particular, the "quantum parameter" $t$ is replaced everywhere by $q$.
