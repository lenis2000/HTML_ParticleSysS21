Recall that the distribution of the height function of the usual uncoloured stochastic six vertex model is mapped to the Hall-Littlewood measure:

In fact, one can extend this to **joint distributions along down-right paths**:

We don't need all down-right paths, but rather a single down line:

Here's the key lemma:

This is left as [[Problems, 5-3#2|Problem 2]].

In particular, the joint distribution of $\mu,\nu$ after summing over $\lambda$ is given by the Hall-Littlewood process

This discussion leads to:

#### Remark about the Schur case

In the case $t=0$, the joint distribution of the height function along down-right paths is given by the Schur process, instead of the Hall-Littlewood process. 

The Schur process is determinantal, which means that the joint distribution may be expressed as a certain Fredholm determinant. In this case, multipoint asymptotic analysis is accessible (in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang regime).

For the case $t\ne 0$, similar multipoint asymptotic analysis is much harder (and we omit this). However, some other asymptotics may be performed; they lead to correlated Gaussian fields.
