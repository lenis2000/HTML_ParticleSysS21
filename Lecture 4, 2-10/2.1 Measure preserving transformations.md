This is called the (one-sided) **Bernoulli shift**. There are several important aspects of this construction. First, this is a way to look at an independent sequence of coin flips from the measure-theoretic perspective, by introducing the measure space $\left\{ 0,1 \right\}^{\mathbb{Z}_{\ge1}}$ with product measure. Then the sequence of independent coin flips becomes the sequence of functions $(x_1,x_2,\ldots )\mapsto x_i$.

Then, the Bernoulli shift $T$ is an example of a not one-to-one measure preserving transformation.

Finally, the Bernoulli shift is a model of the shift by a vector that is used in the LPP limit shape result.

#### Example 2.1.5

Here we use the structure of the product $\sigma$-algebra on the countable product space. Namely, any function measurable with respect to this $\sigma$-algebra (in plain terms, any function depending on the iid coin flips $x_i$) is a limit of functions which depend on finitely many coordinates. Therefore, it essentially is enough to check the condition for invariant functions of finitely many coordinates.
