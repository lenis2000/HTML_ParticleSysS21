#### Proof 3.2.2

We assume that $\vec v=(a,b)$ is an integer vector. Using homogeneity, this allows to extend the result to all rational points. Extending to irrational points is a standard limiting argument.

Let $T$ be the shift by $\vec v$. This is like the Bernoulli shift, but along a direction in $\mathbb{Z}^2$.

Recall that $L(0,n\vec v)$ is the last-passage time from $0$ to $n\vec v$.

Then $L$ satisfies superadditivity:

So:

Finally, $\ell$ is nonrandom because of the ergodicity of $T$, which follows from Kolmogorov 0-1 law.

#### Definition 3.2.3

Recall the notion of the scaled percolation cluster $G$:
