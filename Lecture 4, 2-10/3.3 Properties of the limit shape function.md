#### Theorem 3.3.1

The last passage limit shape function $\ell(a,b)$ satisfies the following properties:
1. $\ell$ is homogeneous, symmetric in $a,b$, and nondecreasing in both arguments
2. Either $\ell=+\infty$ or $\ell<\infty$ for all points
3. $\ell$ is superadditive: $\ell(p+q)\ge \ell(p)+\ell(q)$ for all $p,q\in \mathbb{R}^{2}_{\ge0}$
4. $\ell$ is concave: $\gamma \ell(p)+(1-\gamma)\ell(q)\le \ell(\gamma p+(1-\gamma)q)$, $\gamma\in[0,1]$
5. $\ell$ is continuous

#### Proof 3.3.1

1. Is straightforward
2. If $\ell=+\infty$ at some point, then it is infinite in the whole quadrant. Moreover, the other points can be shifted (using homogeneity) into this quadrant.

3. Superadditivity follows from the same prelimit statement:

4. Superadditivity + homogeneity implies concavity:
$$
\gamma \ell(p)+(1-\gamma)\ell(q)=
\ell(\gamma p)+\ell ( (1-\gamma)p)
\le \ell(\gamma p +(1-\gamma) q).
$$

5. Finite concave functions are continuous.

#### Corollary 3.3.2

Therefore, the boundary of the limit shape cluster looks as follows:

It is concave, continuous, and may contain straight or curved pieces.
