# Notes and references

1. Limit shape theorem for TASEP using hydrodynamics is established in ```Rost, H. Non-equilibrium behaviour of a many particle process: Density profile and local equilibria. Z. Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie verw Gebiete 58, 41–53 (1981)```, [https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00536194](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00536194). This paper also essentially shows that the limit shape of the exponential last passage percolation is a parabola.
2. Explicit limit shape for last passage percolation with geometric weights can be found in ```K. Johansson. Shape fluctuations and random matrices. Commun. Math. Phys., 209(2):437–476, 2000```, [arXiv:math/9903134 [math.CO]](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9903134). However, this is not the first place where this limit shape was obtained.
