If we believe in the parabola limit shape ([[3.4 Explicit limit shapes#Theorem 3 4 1]]), we can derive the limit shape of the TASEP density. 

Moreover, there is a general relation between the height and the density.

Let $H(t,x)$, $t\in \mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$, $x\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge0}$, be the finite-time height function of TASEP. Define
$$
h_t(x)=\lim_{R\to+\infty}H(Rt,\lfloor Rx \rfloor),
$$
and similarly define the limiting density $\rho(t,x)$.

#### Corollary 3.5.2

Modulo [[3.4 Explicit limit shapes#Theorem 3 4 1]], the limiting density of TASEP started from the step initial configuration is
$$
\rho(t,x)=\frac{1}{2}-\frac{x}{2t}.
$$

#### Proof 3.5.2

This is obtained by scaling the parabola by $t$, and differentiating as in [[#Lemma 3 5 1]]. 

Here is an illustration of the density's evolution:
