#### Theorem 2.2.1. Superadditive ergodic theorem

![[../img/Pasted image 20210211100119.png]]

As discussed before, the proof of this result is not given in the course, and is left as an additional readong.

#### Corollary 2.2.2. The classical Birkhoff ergodic theorem

Let $f$ be an integrable function on $\Omega$, and define
$$
g_n(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}f(T^k x).
$$
Then clearly
$$
g_n(x)+g_m(T^nx)=g_{m+n}(x),
$$
which means that $g$ satisfies subadditivity / superadditivity. Then
$$
\lim_{n\to+\infty}\frac{1}{n}g_n(x)\to g(x).
$$
Moreover, because $T$ is measure preserving, in case of ergodic $T$ we have (by taking averages with respect to $\mathsf{P}$):
$$
\frac{1}{n}
\int g_n(x)\,\mathsf{P}(dx)
=
\int f(x)\,\mathsf{P}(dx)
\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad 
\frac{1}{n}g_n(x)\to 
\int f(x)\,\mathsf{P}(dx).
$$

#### Corollary 2.2.3. Law of large numbers

For the Bernoulli shift, we can define $f(x_1,x_2,\ldots )=x_1$. Then $g_n(x)=x_1+\ldots+x_n $, and the result says
$$
\frac{x_1+\ldots+x_n }{n}\to\int x_1\, \mathsf{P}(dx)=\frac{1}{2}.
$$

In fact, the same results holds for any iid sequence of random variables $X_n$, $n\ge1$, where we define the shift $T$ in the same way. This result
$$
\frac{X_1+\ldots+X_n }{n}\to \mathbb{E}(X_1)\qquad \text{almost surely}
$$
is called the (strong) law of large numbers.
