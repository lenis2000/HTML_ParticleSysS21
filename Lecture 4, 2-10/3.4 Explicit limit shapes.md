#### Theorem 3.4.1

For exponental weights with mean $1$, we have:

This is the piece of the parabola which is tangent to both axes at unit points. 

We will prove this theorem eventually in the course.

#### Theorem 3.4.2

For geometric weights $\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge0}$ with parameter $q\in(0,1)$, we have:
$$
\ell(a,b)=b \left(\frac{\left(\sqrt{\frac{a q}{b}}+1\right)^2}{1-q}-1\right)
$$

(note that this function is symmetric in $a,b$)

We will prove this theorem eventually in the course.

#### Open problem 3.4.4

The case of any other iid weights is **wide open**. Namely, we don't know any other explicit limit shapes in the last passage percolation model.
