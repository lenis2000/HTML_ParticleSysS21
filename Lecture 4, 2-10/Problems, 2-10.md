# 1

Prove or find in the literature the proof of the Kolmogorov 0-1 law. That is, let $X_1,X_2,\ldots$ be independent random variables, and $\mathcal{T}$ be the tail $\sigma$-algebra:
$$
\mathcal{T}=\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}\sigma(X_n,X_{n+1},X_{n+2},\ldots ).
$$
In words, $\mathcal{T}$ consists of events which are independent of any finite subcollection of the $X_j$'s. Then, if $A\in \mathcal{T}$, then $\mathsf{P}(A)=0$ or $1$.

# 2

Let $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathsf{P})$ be the unit circle with the normalized length measure. Let $T_\alpha$ be the counterclockwise rotation by the angle $\alpha$. 
1. Show that $T_\alpha$ is measure-preserving
2. Show that for $\alpha$ irrational multiples of $2\pi$, $T_\alpha$ is ergodic
3. Is $T_\alpha$ ergodic for $\alpha$ rational multiples of $2\pi$?
