[[Problems, 2-1|6 problems]] due 2/15

# 1. Introduction 

## 1.1 Links 
- My homepage https://lpetrov.cc
- Course page https://publish.obsidian.md/particle-systems/
- [[../Syllabus | Syllabus]]

## 1.2 Some reminders

1. Lectures are recorded and available by request 
2. It is helpful if you have camera on during lectures
3. If you're taking the class for grade, see [[../Syllabus#Expectations and assessment | this section of the syllabus]]
4. The course is officially "hybrid", so there will be some in-person activities like outside walks and discussions, and maybe class meetings. Nothing is set and planned as of now. All in-person activities will either be optional, or with remote participation possible

## 1.3 Please introduce yourself

What is your background in...

- Probability theory, graduate and undergraduate?
- Symmetric functions?
- Real analysis (as in, measure theory)?

## 1.4 Preview

One rather famous particle system - the sticky tetris / ballistic deposition - models a lot of interesting behaviours. A readable account is [here](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v6/7). Unfortunately, this system is not mathematically tractable (yet).

[And here](https://wt.iam.uni-bonn.de/ferrari/research/jsanimationtasep) is an animation of an "integrable" particle system TASEP (totally asymmetric simple exclusion process), which demonstrates a lot of the same behavior (which is conjectural for the ballistic deposition). This system can be solved exactly - we know "everything" about its probability distribution and asymptotics.

# 4 Notes and references

1. On measure theory, most graduate books work well. At UVA we typically use ``` Gerald B. Folland. Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications. 2nd Edition```.
2. Basic graduate probability theory is the subject of numerous textbooks. I was learning from ```Albert N. Shiryaev. Probability```, there is a new English edition: Part [I](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387722054), [II](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387722078).
3. A great short book on Poisson processes which does not require too much background: ```J. F. C. Kingman. Poisson Processes. Clarendon Press, 1993```.
