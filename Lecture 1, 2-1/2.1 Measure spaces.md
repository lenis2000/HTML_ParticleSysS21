We will need both probability measures (on them we define randomness), and measure spaces like $\mathbb{R}$ with Lebesgue measure. On $\mathbb{R}$ (or $\mathbb{Z}$) we will define random point configurations and particle systems in particular.

For the present lecture, we mostly stick to the probability context.
