Using the Fredholm determinants, asymptotics of the kernel, and some more estimates, we have

#### Remark 2.6.2

Note that by the very nature of the Fredholm determinant $\det\left( 1-K^{Ai} \right)_{(r,+\infty)}$, it is reasonable to guess that as $r\to \pm\infty$, the Fredholm determinant converges to $1$ and $0$, respectively. This is to be expected of a cumulative distribution function.

#### Proof 2.6.1

We also need to estimate the kernel $K(x,y)$ for $y$ away from the neighborhood of $\lfloor \chi^* N \rfloor $. This may be done as follows:
$$
|K(x,y)|<C(z^*)^{(r-s)N^{1/3}} \frac{e^{-c_1 N^{1/3}}+e^{c_2 N^{-1/3}(y-\lfloor \chi^*N \rfloor )}}{\lfloor \chi^* N \rfloor -y+1},
$$
if $y-\lfloor \chi^* N \rfloor < -sN^{1/3}$ for some $s>0$. 

This estimate may be proven by further analysis of the double contour integral formula for the kernel.
