 [[Lecture 14, 3-22/Problems, 3-22\|4 problems]], due April 5

Here we finish the proof of the TASEP fluctuations, and discuss the results.

# 1 Recall the formulas we have for TASEP

- [[1.1 Kernel]]
- [[1.2 Fredholm determinants, general discussion]]
- [[1.3 How to compute Fredholm asymptotics]]

# 2 Kernel asymptotics and Fredholm determinants

- [[2.1 The part with the single critical point]]
- [[2.2 Edge and critical point behavior]]
- [[2.3 Expansion around the double critical point]]
- [[2.4 Asymptotics of the kernel]]
- [[2.5 Airy kernel]]
- [[2.6 Fredholm determinant asymptotics]]

# 3 Discussion of the asymptotics

- [[3.1 Tracy-Widom distribution]]
- [[3.2 KPZ universality]]
