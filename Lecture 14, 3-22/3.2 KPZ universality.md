Most stochastic particle systems with strong dependence are believed (and proven) to be in the so-called KPZ (Kardar-Parisi-Zhang) universality class. The name for the class comes from a stochastic PDE introduced in the work of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang in 1986. 

There are several versions of fluctuation distribution (which are the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution and its relatives):
