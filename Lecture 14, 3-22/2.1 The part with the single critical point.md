See [[Problems, 3-22#2|Problem 2]]

This _discrete sine kernel_ determinantal process is a fundamental object, as it appears in asymptotics of many models.

A continuous analogue of the discrete sine kernel process on $\mathbb{R}$ is useful in describing spacings between zeroes of the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ on the critical line $\mathrm{Re}(s)=\frac{1}{2}$.
