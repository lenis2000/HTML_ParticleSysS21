To address multiple $t$-moments, consider a slightly different operator

#### Proposition 3.3.1

This follows from the expression for $D(t,0)$.

Using the relation between the stochastic six vertex model and Hall-Littlewood measures, we have:

Now let us express this in integrals. Start with the case $k=2$.

Here, however, we need to respect algebra, and not pick the residue at $w=zt$. This is achieved by a careful selection of contours. 

Take these (I call $z_1=z$, $z_2=w$ for easier matching with the next contour picture):

By continuing for larger $k$, we get the following $k$-fold contour integral formulas:

#### Corollary 3.3.4

For the stochastic six vertex model:

Contours are the same as in [[#Theorem 3 3 3|the previous theorem]].
