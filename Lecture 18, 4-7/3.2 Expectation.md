We repeat the technology used for Schur measures (see [[../Lecture 11, 3-10/2.1 Expectation via q-difference operators|this part]]), and compute the expectation of the eigenvalue through Cauchy identity. 

We have:

Now we apply contour integrals, and also recall that $h(M,N)$ has the same distribution as $N-\ell(\lambda)$, to write:

#### Proposition 3.2.1

Here the integration contour is around all the $x_i$'s.

We have proven this result above.

#### Note on notation

Here I silently switched from $u_i,v_j$ variables to $x_i,y_j$ ones, and the lattice coordinates are $M,N$. This notation with $x_i,y_j$ will persist till the end of the lecture.

#### Proposition 3.2.2

Integration over a different contour corresponds to a simpler quantity that we take expectation of. Namely,

![[../img/Pasted image 20210407214005.png]]

There are two changes: different contour, and the lack of $(t-1)$ in the denominator.

#### Proof 3.2.2

This follows from the fact that the residue of the integrand at zero is equal to $1/(t-1)$, which is immediate since $0$ is a simple pole.
