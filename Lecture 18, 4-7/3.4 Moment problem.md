The expectations $\mathbb{E}t^{kh(M,N)}$ for all $k\ge1$ determine the distribution of $h(M,N)$. 

Indeed, since $t^{h(M,N)}\in(0,1]$, this follows from the compact moment problem:

#### Theorem 3.4.1

Let $\nu$ be a probability measure supported on a compact segment $\left[ a,b \right]$. Then its moments $\alpha_k=\int_a^b x^k \nu(dx)$ completely determine $\nu$.

This statement follows from Weierstrass theorem on approximation of continuous functions by polynomials.
