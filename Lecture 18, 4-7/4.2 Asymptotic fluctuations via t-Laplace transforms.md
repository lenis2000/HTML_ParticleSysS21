Let us apply the t-binomial theorem to t-moments:

#### Theorem 4.2.1

We have

#### Proof 4.2.1

This is allowed: we can interchange expectation with summation because the random variable $t^{h(M,N)}$ is bounded.

Note that the right-hand side is called "t-Laplace transform", because

The t-Laplace transform is helpful for asymptotic analysis:

Here $\eta$ should be the Tracy-Widom random variable, as in TASEP.

Take

Then:

We believe that the probability in the right-hand side is expressed as (1 minus the) Fredholm determinant of the Airy kernel. This determinantal structure is quite special, and we don't see it yet before the limit.

To see the Fredholm determinant in the limit, it is actually possible to first obtain this structure before the limit. We will do this next time.
