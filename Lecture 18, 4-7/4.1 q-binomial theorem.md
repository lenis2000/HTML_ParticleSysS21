Let us step back and consider possible generating functions associated with our $t$-moments of the height function. 

#### Theorem 4.1.1. q-binomial theorem

This is usually called the q-binomial theorem, however, our t plays the role of q.

If $|t|<1$, $|\zeta|<1$, then

#### Proof 4.1.1

This would follow from a more general identity as $N\to\infty$.

We will write down a recurrence for the series coefficients $c_{N,n}$.

This shows the more general identity depending on $N$. Finally, the limit as $N\to\infty$ looks as
