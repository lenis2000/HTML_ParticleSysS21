#### Remark 2.2.2

The existence of TASEP is not too obvious, as the process makes infinitely many jumps in finite time. Sure, the interaction is local, but there is no deterministic bound on the lenght of the interaction for any finite time. Therefore, one cannot say that the system evolves independently in some finite-size blocks.

#### Remark 2.2.3. Basic coupling

From the proof of Theorem 2.2.1, we see that it is possible to put onto the same probability space all TASEPs started from all possible initial configurations. Indeed, for this we only need to use the same Poisson process, sampled once. This probability space is the space for the Poisson process on $\bigsqcup_{i\in \mathbb{Z}}\mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$.

In particle systems literature, this construction of all TASEPs on the same probability space is called _basic coupling_.

#### Remark 2.2.4

There is an explicit procedure for sampling the Poisson process. It is not required for our process on $\bigsqcup_{i\in \mathbb{Z}}\mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$, because here it suffices just to take countably many independent exponential random variables $\mathrm{Exp}(\lambda)$, and they would be the inter-arrival times. 

However, for Poisson processes on general spaces (even consider the Poisson process on the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ --- there are no exponential inter-arrival times), there is a nice explicit procedure. Suppose that our space $X=\bigsqcup_{n}X_n$ is a countable union of spaces with $\mu(X_n)<\infty$ (such a space $X$ is called $\sigma$-finite). Then, for each $X_n$, sample a Poisson random variable $N_n$ with mean $\mu(X_n)$. After that, sample $N_n$ independent points in $X_n$ with distribution $\mu(\cdot)/\mu(X_n)$. The collection of all these points is the Poisson process.

See [[Problems, 2-3#3]], where you need to prove that this sampling indeed produces the desired Poisson process.
