# 1 

Let $\Pi$ be a Poisson process on $(X,\mathcal{F},\mu)$. For each point in $\Pi$, independently for all points, erase this point with probability $p\in(0,1)$. Denote the resulting configuration by $\Pi'$. Show that $\Pi'$ is again a Poisson process, and find the corresponding mean measure $\mu'$ for it.

# 2

Adapt the proof of the existence of TASEP to the case of a generic countable bounded degree directed graph $G=(V,E)$. The bounded degree condition means that there exists $d\ge 1$ such that all degrees (incoming and outgoing, if needed) do not exceed $d$.

# 3

Show that the sampling procedure of a Poisson process on a general $\sigma$-finite space $X$ described in Remark 2.2.4 indeed produces the point configuration distributed as the Poisson process. 

# ?

This is a question to think for a week, the answer will be given in the next lecture on Feb 7.
