## ASEP

Here parameter $t$ is a number between $0$ and $1$, and not a time parameter. While this notation might be unfortunate, it has reasons within integrability.

The configuration $X^{(2)}$ should be "bigger" than $X^{(1)}$, notation $X^{(2)}\succ X^{(1)}$. This means that if a location $i\in \mathbb{Z}$ is occupied under $X^{(1)}$, then it must be occupied under $X^{(2)}$.

Possible nontrivial transitions (each at rate $1$) in this TASEP are

Therefore, we call $(1,1)$ a _first-class particle_, and $(0,1)$ a _second-class particle_. That is, first-order particles treat second-class particles as empty space.

## PushASEP

Under PushASEP, each particle jumps to the right according to the TASEP rules (in particular, the jump is blocked if the destination is occupied), at rate $R$. And in parallel, each particle jumps to the left at rate $L$ to the left, but any particle can jump, and the jumping particle lands at the nearest empty space to the left. Therefore, there is no blocking mechanism in left jumps, but rather one can say that there is a "pushing" mechanism.

## q-TASEP

Here $0\le q<1$ is a parameter. Each particle jumps to the right by one at rate $1-q^{\mathrm{gap}}$, where $\mathrm{gap}$ is the distance to the nearest particle to the right. If $\mathrm{gap}=+\infty$ (i.e., the configuration has the rightmost particle), then the jump is with rate $1$.

When $q=0$, $q$-TASEP turns into the usual TASEP, as 
$$
1-0^n=1,\ n\ge1,\qquad 1-0^0=0.
