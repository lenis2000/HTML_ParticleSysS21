# Notes and references

1. A great short book on Poisson processes which does not require too much background: ```J. F. C. Kingman. Poisson Processes. Clarendon Press, 1993```.
1. Picture of Poisson vs determinantal point processes is taken from ```J. Ben Hough, Manjunath Krishnapur, Yuval Peres, and Bálint Virág. Determinantal Processes and Independence```, https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ps/1146832696
2. TASEP was introduced in probability theory and biology almost simultaneously, around 50 years ago:
	- ```C. MacDonald, J. Gibbs, and A. Pipkin. “Kinetics of biopolymerization on nucleic acid templates”. In: Biopolymers 6.1 (1968), pp. 1–25```.
	- ```F. Spitzer. “Interaction of Markov processes”. In: Adv. Math. 5.2 (1970), pp. 246–290```.
3. The graphical construction (in the proof of the existence of TASEP) is due to ```Harris, T. E. Additive set-valued Markov processes and graphical methods. Ann. Probability 6 (1978), no. 3, 355–378```.
4. The "basic coupling" leading to the coloured TASEP dates back to at least ```T. M. LIGGETT, Interacting Particle Systems, Springer, Berlin, 1985```.
5. A survey on point processes (including the notion of convergence of probability measures on point configurations) is Soshnikov's [survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0002099).
