Here we recall the main ingredients that we proved so far.

#### 1.0.1 Schur and TASEP matching

Note that the integral has the following singularities:

- At infinity there are essential singularities
- Pole at $w=0$
- Pole at $z=1$
- Simple pole at $w=z$

There are no other singularities. In particular, we can drag the $z$ contour through $0$, and/or the $w$ contour through $1$.
