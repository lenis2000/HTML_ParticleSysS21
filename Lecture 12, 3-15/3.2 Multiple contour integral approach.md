In fact, there is hope, and it's based on two "magic" steps:

First, the $2x$-fold contour integral can be rewritten as $x\times x$ deteminant of double integrals. This is still a deteminant of growing size, but... Second, there is a certain structure of this growing determinant (it is in fact equal to a certain Fredholm determinant), which allows to analyze it asymptotically.
