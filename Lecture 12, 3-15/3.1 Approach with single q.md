Let us indicate a possible approach using the fact that the single-$q$ integral for the expectation over the Schur measure has $q$ as a free parameter.

This expectation should be a combination of $0,1$, and $\infty$ with some weights. Maybe there is a way of working this approach towards at least the right order of the fluctuations $N^{1/3}$?
