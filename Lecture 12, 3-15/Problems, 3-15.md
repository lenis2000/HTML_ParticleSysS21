# 1

Prove Lemmas 2a, 2b, 2c in [[2.3 Density - last steps of the proof|here]] on the locations of the critical points of $S$.

# 2
Using [[2.1 Formulation#Theorem 2 1 1|Theorem 2.1.1]], draw the curves for the limit shapes of Young diagrams under the Schur measre $SM_{(1,\ldots,1;\rho_{\tau N} )}$ in the limit regime $N\to\infty$. This is a family of curves parametrized by $\tau$.


# T5

Think whether the approach using the single-$q$ integral could be developed into an asymptotic fluctuation result by somehow extracting the smallest power of $q$ in the expectation. See [[3.1 Approach with single q|this part]] for details.
