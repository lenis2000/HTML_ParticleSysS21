Let us leave contour integrals for a moment, and show how the parabola limit shape of the TASEP height function is obtained from the result of [[2.1 Formulation#Theorem 2 1 1|Theorem 2.1.1]]. 

#### 2.2.1. Asymptotics of the N-th particle

We have

(we assume that $\tau>0$, because for $\tau\le 1$ the particle $x_N$ has not yet started moving, and so its location is determined)

The theorem thus gives:

#### 2.2.2. Homogeneity trick

We see that this gives the desired $\rho(\tau,\chi)$, and the parabola height function.

#### 2.2.4. Remark

We have checked that $\rho(\tau,\chi)$ satisfies the Burgers equation, but to rigorously conclude that this is the TASEP limiting density we need local invariance of the TASEP distributions, and also some PDE theory.

This proof of the formula for $\rho(\tau,\chi)$ is more "elementary" as it relies only on the analysis of the exact formula for the density.
