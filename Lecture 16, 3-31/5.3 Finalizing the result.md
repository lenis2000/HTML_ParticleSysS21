Now let us connect [[5.2 Constructing random steps from couplings of YBE#Theorem 5 2 1 Main theorem|our theorem]] to the stochastic six vertex model.

The signatures should be understood as if in the square

Then the 6 cases in [[5.2 Constructing random steps from couplings of YBE#Theorem 5 2 1 Main theorem|the theorem]] correspond to the following cases in the stochastic six vertex model.

Therefore, we get the following theorem

#### Theorem 5.3.1. S6V to HL coupling.

Take the stochastic six vertex model, with inhomogeneous parameters $u_1,u_2,\ldots$ along the vertical, and $v_1,v_2,\ldots$ along the horizontal directions. The stochastic six vertex model updates the vertex at $(x,y)$ with probabilities
$$
b_1(u_y,v_x)=\frac{1-u_yv_x}{1-tu_yv_x},\qquad 
b_2(u_y,v_x)=t\frac{1-u_yv_x}{1-tu_yv_x}.
$$

Then the height function of this stochastic six vertex model (with domain wall like boundary conditions in $\mathbb{Z}_{\ge0}^2$, i.e., paths enters at each site on the left boundary and nothing enters from below) has the following equality in distribution:
$$
h(x,y)\stackrel{d}{=}m_0(\lambda^{(x,y)})=y-\ell(\lambda^{(x,y)}),
$$
where $\lambda^{(x,y)}$ is the random signature distributed according to the Hall-Littlewood measure 
$$
\mathrm{Prob}(\lambda)=\prod_{i=1}^x\prod_{j=1}^y
\frac{1-u_jv_i}{1-tu_jv_i}\,
P_\lambda(u_1,\ldots,u_y )
Q_\lambda(v_1,\ldots,v_x ).
$$
