Without normalization, we use the notation $F_\lambda$:

#### Proposition 3.2.2

Note that we're not yet proving that $P_\lambda$ is symmetric in the variables. 

#### Proof 3.2.2

1. The polynomiality is clear because all weights are polynomial, and the partition function is of a finite sum
2. Homogeneity follows from the fact that the weight $u$ is attached to a horizontal outgoing arrow, so the total power of each monomial in $u_i$ is $|\lambda|$
3. The lexicographically maximal monomial corresponds to a unique path configuration

	Dividing by the normalizing factor, we get the desired result
