#### Lemma 4.4.1. Skew Cauchy identity

For $|xy|<1$, we have

#### Proof 4.4.1

We also consider equality of two partition functions:

Add the empty cross vertex on the left:

Move it over, and get the other side of the skew Cauchy identity:

#### Proposition 4.4.2. Full Cauchy identity

We have two equivalent identities (provided that $|u_iv_j|<1$ for all $i,j$):

#### Important notes about the function Q

In L16 and L17 I made a mistake in the definition of the function $Q_\lambda$. The correct $Q_\lambda$ can be reconstructed as follows, from the Cauchy identities:

I have edited all the notes so that the old function $Q_\lambda$ is now denoted by $Q_\lambda^*$. The function $Q_\lambda$ is, by definition, dual to $P_\lambda$ in the sense of the Cauchy identity.

#### Proof 4.4.2

We will prove the identity with $F$. Again, this is an equality of two partition functions.
