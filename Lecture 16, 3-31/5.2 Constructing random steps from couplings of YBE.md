We reduce the sampling of $\nu$ to a sequence of sampling of the $\nu_i$'s using the YBE on each step.

## A general principle

Any identity with nonnegative terms can be made into a Markov chain (in multiple ways, in fact). This is known as "bijectivisation", "coupling", or "probabilistic bijection".

To conclude, a coupling exists; and if there is a singleton in the left-hand side, then the coupling is unique.

This discussion proves the following result:

#### Theorem 5.2.1. Main theorem.

The desired $U(\nu\mid \lambda,\varkappa,\mu)$ exists, on the leftmost column $0$ it is unique and looks like this:
