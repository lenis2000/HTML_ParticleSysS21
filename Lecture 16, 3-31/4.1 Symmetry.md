#### Theorem 4.1.2. Yang-Baxter equation (YBE)

We have the following equality of partition functions:

#### Proof 4.1.2

The proof is a direct verification of an identity involving summing over $k_1,k_2,k_3$.

#### Proof 4.1.3

Via YBE, we have the equality of two partition functions

This allows to swap $u_i$ and $u_{i+1}$, resulting in the symmetry.
