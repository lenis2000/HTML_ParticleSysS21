The goal now is to use the skew Cauchy identity to upgrade the height function random field to a random field of $\lambda$'s. This means that we need to come up with a rule of randomly selecting $\nu$ given $\lambda, \varkappa,\mu$:

By "compatible with skew Cauchy" we mean

This property, upon summing over $\nu$, leads to the skew Cauchy:
