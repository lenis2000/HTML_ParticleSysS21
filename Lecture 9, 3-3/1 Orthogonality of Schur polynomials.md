#### Definition 1.0.1

Here we define an inner product on the space of symmetric polynomials, under which Schur polynomials are orthonormal:

#### Proof 2 of Theorem 1.0.2. Via difference operators

We can prove a weaker statement, orthogonality, using difference operators.

Recall the difference operators $D_q$.

One can show that $D_q$ are self-adjoint with respect to the inner product $\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle$, that is, $\langle D_q f,g \rangle =\langle f,D_q g \rangle$. See [[Problems, 3-3#1| Problem 1]]. 

Then
