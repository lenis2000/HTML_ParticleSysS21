Let us now shift the focus a little bit. Instead of trying to show that the push-block dynamics is related to Gibbs property and Schur processes, let us develop the push-block dynamics as a particular case of a **multilayer dynamics** on interlacing arrays. The ingredients which we use are the commuting operators $\Lambda$ and $P_N$'s.

## Two layers

We begin the discussion with two levels $N-1$ and $N$. Then we will find the solution, a Markov operator $Q$ from $\left\{ (\bar \lambda,\lambda)\colon \bar \lambda\prec \lambda \right\}\subset GT_{N-1}^+\times GT_{N}^+$ to itself in the form

There are many good couplings. One can show that they are encoded by functions $U$ satisfying:

The second condition means that on "Gibbs" distributions, i.e., on those compatible with $\Lambda$, the update $\lambda\to\nu$ is governed by the upper Markov chain $P_N$.

For a particular solution (in fact, the simplest one), we pick $U$ in the form

In other words, we update $\bar\lambda\to\bar \nu$ on the lower level first, and then pick $\nu$ as the middle point in the Markov chain $\lambda\to\nu\to\bar\nu$, conditioned on $\lambda$ and $\bar\nu$. This effectively "forgets" the state $\bar\lambda$.


## Multiple layers

For any fixed number $N$ of layers, we update $\lambda^{(1)}\to\nu^{(1)}$ first, then given the update on the first layer, update the second layer using $U$, and so on. On each pair of consecutive levels, we use the two-level mechanism described above.


#### Theorem 4.2.1

Thus defined Markov operator $Q$ on interlacing arrays with $N$ rows preserves the class of Gibbs measures.

#### Proof 4.2.1

This follows from the properties of $U$. The update looks like:

The action on Gibbs measures looks like:
