#### Theorem 4.1.3

We have the following commuting diagram of Markov operators:

(By $\lambda$, etc., we denote the elements of these sets)

In other words, for a fixed $\lambda$, the conditional distributions of $\bar\nu$ obtained by applying operators along two routes are the same.

#### Proof 4.1.3

Let us write this out:

Then there are lots of cancellations:
