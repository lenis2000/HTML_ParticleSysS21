#### Proposition 2.0.1

We have an integral formula for Schur polynomials:

#### Proof 2.0.1

Recall Cauchy identity

![[../img/Pasted image 20210304214234.png]]

Multiply it by $\overline{s_\lambda(x)}$ and integrate using orthogonality. This picks out the right coefficient:

$\square$

This proof requires some justifications of convergence, see [[Problems, 3-3#2|Problem 2]].
