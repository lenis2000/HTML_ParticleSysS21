The coupling between S6V and HL measures goes through the height function

We consider an inhomogeneous model with parameters $u_1,u_2,\ldots$ in the horizontal, and $v_1,v_2,\ldots$ in the vertical direction. 

Here is an example simulation:

#### Theorem 1.3.1 (proved in L16)

#### Remark 1.3.2

Since $Q_\lambda=b_\lambda P_\lambda$, we may as well have written $\frac{1}{Z}P_\lambda(u_1,\ldots,u_x )Q_\lambda(v_1,\ldots,v_y )$.

#### Remark 1.3.3

Joint distributions of the height function $h(x,y)$ are also available through Hall--Littlewood processes. Well, not all joint distributions, but only those along down-right paths. Since asymptotic analysis of Hall--Littlewood processes (and of these joint distributions) is much more involved, we do not focus on this more general coupling.
