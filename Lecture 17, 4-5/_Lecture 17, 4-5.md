# Notes and references

1. Macdonald's book: ```I.G.Macdonald. Symmetric Functions and Hall Polynomials (Oxford Classic Texts in the Physical Sciences), 2nd ed. 1995.```
	- Chapter III contains most formulas on Hall-Littlewood polynomials and symmetric functions
	- Chapter III.3,5 develops a proof of the symmetrization formula through the Hall algebra (involved in the study of abelian p-groups)
	- A potential another proof of the symmetrization formula might be developed by looking at identity III.(2.14), if one manages to prove the same identity at the vertex model level.
2. A verification style proof of the symmetrization formula (in a more general fashion) may be found in ```A. Borodin. On a family of symmetric rational functions```, https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0976, Theorem 5.1.
3. The proof presented here follows Algebraic Bethe ansatz ideology, and follows the one in ```A. Borodin, L. Petrov. Higher spin six vertex model and symmetric rational functions```, https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05770, Theorem 4.14.1.
4. On Algebraic Bethe ansatz see, e.g., ```Korepin, V. and Bogoliubov, N. and Izergin, A. Quantum inverse scattering method and correlation functions```, 1993. In particular, see formula VII.(5.9) and Appendix VII.2
