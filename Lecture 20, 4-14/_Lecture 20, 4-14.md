# 1 Asymptotics of Fredholm determinants

Throughout this section we perform a critical point analysis of the Fredholm determinant for the $t$-Laplace transform of the height function in the stochastic six vertex model.

- [[1.1 Recall what we work with]]
- [[1.2 Expansion we work with]]
- [[1.3 Homogeneous parameters in the model]]
- [[1.4 Summary of the strategy]]
- [[1.5 Double critical point]]
- [[1.6 Heuristics of the cone in the limit shape]]
- [[1.7 Moving the contours]]
- [[1.8 Expansion around the critical point and asymptotics]]
