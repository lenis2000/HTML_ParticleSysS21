[[Course abstract]]

## Meeting times 

**Mondays and Wednesdays 3:30pm - 4:45pm**, Charlottesville time. See the [[Main|main course page]] for the calendar schedule.

The zoom link is in collab. Please email me ([lenia.petrov@gmail.com](mailto:lenia.petrov@gmail.com)) if you'd like to audit the course.

## Office hours

Mondays 10-10:30, Wednesdays 9:30-10:00, or by appointment (you can make as many appointments as you like).

## Expectations and assessment

This is a topics course. There are two main components in a course grade:

1. Attendance at lectures. Reasonable attendance at live lectures (say, >50% of lectures) is one of the best indicators that you're paying attention and are not falling behind.
2. Ten-minute talks. Everyone will be invited to give one or two ten-minute talks on their research interest or a selected reading related to the course.
3. Submission of homework assignments. Problems will be posted after most lectures, and I expect that you attempt (meaning solve & submit) at least one problem for >50% lectures for which there are homework problems. Please use email [lenia.petrov@gmail.com](mailto:lenia.petrov@gmail.com) for homework submission. Each problem's solution will be released two weeks after the problem is posted, so you have two weeks deadline to submit solutions for grade.

There are no tests or exams.

## Lectures

All lectures are recorded, and recordings are available upon request. Zoom policy - at lectures I ask you to have your cameras on, mic off for best experience. You can ask questions by voice or in zoom chat.

Course material (lecture PDFs, problem sets, and other notes) is available via links from [[Main|this page]].

## Note on hybrid course delivery

This course is listed as "hybrid" which means that some in-person activities will happen. I am planning to hold some in-person meetings in March or April when the pandemic situation could improve, and more guidance from UVA is available.
