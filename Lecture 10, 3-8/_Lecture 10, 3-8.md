# Notes and references

1. The idea of commuting Markov operators is originally due to ```P. Diaconis and J.A. Fill, Strong stationary times via a new form of duality, Ann. Probab. 18 (1990), 1483–1522.```
2. Application commuting Markov operators to interlacing arrays is due to ```A. Borodin and P. Ferrari, Anisotropic growth of random surfaces in 2+1 dimensions, Comm. Math. Phys. 325 (2014), 603–684, arXiv:0804.3035 [math-ph].``` See also section 2 in ```A. Borodin and L. Petrov, Nearest neighbor Markov dynamics on Macdonald processes, (2013), arXiv:1305.5501 [math.PR]``` for a more general construction.
