We claim that the continuous time limit of the multilevel dynamics as $y=dt\to0$ is the push-block process. Here we set $x_i\equiv 1$, and need to replace the variable $\widetilde y$ which enters $P_N$ by the continuous specialization $\rho_{dt}$. By  [[Problems, 3-8#4|Problem 4]], this is the same as simply taking the expansion of all the Markov operators into series in $\widetilde y$. Therefore, we can simply replace $\widetilde y$ by the specialization $\rho_{dt}$ everywhere in the computations. 

#### Example 3.1.1. Case N=1.

#### Proposition 3.1.2

In the general case, using [[Problems, 3-8|Problems]], we can show that:

#### Theorem 3.1.3

In the limit $dt\to0$, the push-block component $U(\nu\mid \lambda,\bar\nu)$ becomes:

1. If $\bar\nu\prec \lambda$:
$$
U(\nu\mid \lambda,\bar\nu)=\begin{cases}
	dt,&|\nu|=|\lambda|+1,\ \lambda\prec\nu,\ \bar\nu\prec \nu;\\
	1-O(dt),&\nu=\lambda;\\
	O(dt^2),&\text{else}.
\end{cases}
$$
In the multilevel dynamics $Q$, this corresponds to an independent jump of any **unblocked** particle at rate $1$ if $\bar\lambda=\bar\nu$ (there were no jumps at lower levels); or to no move if $\bar \lambda=\bar \nu$ and $\bar\nu\prec\lambda$ (if there were moves at lower levels). Note that the condition $\bar\nu\prec\nu$ corresponds to **blocking**: if a move $\lambda\to\nu$ would violate the interlacting, then this move is blocked.

2. If $\bar\nu\not\prec\lambda$, we have $U(\nu\mid \lambda,\bar\nu)=1$ for the unique $\nu$ which would restore the interlacing $\nu\succ\lambda$, $\nu\succ \bar \nu$.

#### Proof 3.1.3

![[../img/Pasted image 20210309113115.png]]

For the first case, the denominator is of a constant order, and so in the numerator we pick something of constant order and of order $dt$. We have

This implies our [[../Lecture 9, 3-3/3 Push-block dynamics and Schur process#Theorem 3 0 1|main result]] from the previous lecture, and the [[../Lecture 9, 3-3/3 Push-block dynamics and Schur process#Corollary 3 0 2|corollary]] about connection to TASEP.

In particular, the action of the push-block process on the Schur process $SP_{(1,\ldots,1;\rho_t )}$ for some other time $t'$ produces the Schur process $SP_{(1,\ldots,1;\rho_{t+t'} )}$.
