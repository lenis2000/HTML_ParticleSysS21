#### Definition 2.1.1

Recall that an abstract Gibbs measure is defined as follows:

That is, we take an arbitrary probability distribution $M$ on the $N$-th floor $GT_N^+$, and attach to it a chain of $\Lambda$'s.

#### Theorem 2.1.2

The multilevel process $Q$ preserves the class of abstract Gibbs measures. Moreover, the action on a Gibbs measure as above changes $M$ as 
$$
M\mapsto \widetilde M(\nu)=\sum_{\lambda\in GT_N^+}M(\lambda)P_N(\lambda,\nu)
$$

#### Proof 2.1.2

The key fact is the followin **refinement** of the commutation relation:

We apply it repeatedly:

In the fist step, the sum over $\lambda^{(1)}$ involves only the highlighted terms, and they produce $P_2(\lambda^{(2)},\nu^{(2)})\Lambda(\nu^{(2)},\nu^{(1)})$.

Similarly, on the next step, $P_2,U_3$, and $\Lambda(\lambda^{(3)},\lambda^{(2)})$ leads to $P_3$ and $\Lambda(\nu^{(3)},\nu^{(2)})$. 

This process goes in the same manner till $\lambda^{(N)}$. The final summation over $\lambda^{(N)}$ involves $M$ and $P_N$, and produces the action $M\mapsto \widetilde{M}$ as in the claim. This completes the proof.
