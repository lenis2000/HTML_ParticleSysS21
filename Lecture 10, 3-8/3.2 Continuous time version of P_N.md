Recall the operator of the marginal Markov process on $GT_N^+$:

This is the marginal evolution of the $N$-th level, **on Gibbs measures**. 

#### Theorem 3.2.1

For $y=\rho_t$, the Markov process $P_N$ becomes a Markov jump process with the following jump rates:

This theorem follows from lemma:

#### Example 3.2.3

So, $P_N$ becomes a particle system, in which particles jump to the right by one, provided that the desination is not occupied. However, this process is **not the same** as TASEP, and they have very different jump rates. In TASEP, the jump rates are "local", while in $P_N$, the jump rates depend on the whole configuration.
