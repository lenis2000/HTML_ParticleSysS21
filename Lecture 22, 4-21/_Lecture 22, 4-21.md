In this lecture we give an overview of coloured vertex models. There is a motivation coming from quantum groups / R matrices, and after briefly discussing it I introduced a number of concrete examples.

# Notes and references

1. Coloured stochastic vertex models are discussed in many recent works, starting from Borodin-Wheeler, https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01866
2. Connections of R matrices to quantum groups is a rich subject which we only briefly mentioned. For example, an accessible introduction (by Ivan Loseu) may be found here: https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~il282/RT/RT13.pdf, available also at this link: [[../img/RT13.pdf]]
3. Higher spin stochastic vertex models are discussed, for example, in papers https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05770, https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06815
