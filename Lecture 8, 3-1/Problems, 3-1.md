# 3

Evaluate the [[4.2 Proof via determinants#Lemma 4 2 2 Cauchy determinant|Cauchy determinant]] via induction on $N$ Desnanot-Jacobi identity (also known as Dodgson condensation / Lewis Caroll identity):

That is, show that the right-hand side of the Cauchy identity satisfies the same quadratic relations.

# 4

Show that the skew Cauchy identity (see [[4.3 Skew Cauchy identity and a bijective proof#Theorem 4 3 1 Skew Cauchy identity|here]]) for arbitrary number of variables follows from the skew Cauchy identity for single variables. For this, use the "branching" of skew Schur polynomials.

# 5
Show that the bijection given in [[4.3 Skew Cauchy identity and a bijective proof#Proof 4 3 1|this proof]] indeed preserves the powers of $x,y$ as it should. 

# 6

Finish the proof of [[5 Schur measures and processes#Proposition 5 0 4|the marginal distribution under the Schur process]].

# T4

By T$i$ I will suggest topics for 10-minute talks, where $i$ is a counter throughout all lectures. For the fourth idea, I propose to explain how the bijective proof of the skew Cauchy identity given in [[4.3 Skew Cauchy identity and a bijective proof|this part]] upgrades to the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth correspondence.
