Here it is crucial that $M=N$. 

#### Lemma 4.2.1. Cauchy-Binet identity.

For $K\ge N$:

Note two particular cases, $N=1$ is the definition of the matrix product. And $N=K$ is the fact that $\det(AB)=\det A\cdot \det B$.

For the proof, we refer to [[Problems, 3-1#1|Problem 1]].

We apply Cauchy-Binet identity to infinite matrices:

It remains to compute an explicit $N\times N$ determinant.

#### Lemma 4.2.2. Cauchy determinant

#### Proof 4.2.2

There are two ways to prove this. We refer to [[Problems, 3-1#2|Problem 2]] and [[Problems, 3-1#3|Problem 3]].
