#### Theorem 4.1.1. Cauchy identity

![[../img/Pasted image 20210301220630.png]]

#### Remark 4.1.2 

From stability ([[2 Basic properties of Schur polynomials#Proposition 2 0 2 Stability of Schur polynomials|here]]) it follows that the numbers of variables can be different, $x_1,\ldots,x_N$ and $y_1,\ldots,y_M$. However, for the first proof it is essential that $M=N$.

#### Example 4.1.3

When $N=1$, Cauchy identity reduces to the geometric sum:
$$
\sum_{n\ge0} x^n y^n=\frac{1}{1-xy},\qquad |xy|<1.
$$
