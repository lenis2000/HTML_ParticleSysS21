Show that if $s$ is an elementary transposition $(i,i+1)$ and $w\in S_N$, such that $\ell(sw)=\ell(w)-1$, then we can represent $w=sw'$ for some $w'\in S_N$.

# 2 

Show that the twisted R matrix composed of the stochastic coloured vertex weights satisfies the quardatic relation

for an arbitrary number of colours $n$.

Hint: represent the operator $R$ in the tensor product $V\otimes V$ as

Then squaring this expression is straightforward using the matrix units $E_{ij}$.
