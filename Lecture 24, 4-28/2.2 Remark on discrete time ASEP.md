We arrive at the following swap rules:

#### Remark 2.2.1

The elements $Y_{s_i,x}$ may be also taken with different parameters $Y_{s_i,x_i}$. Then the parameters $x_i$ are attached to bonds in the ASEP. This particle system is not (yet?) integrable, in the sense that we don't know of reasonable formulas which allow for an asymptotic analysis. However, the color-position symmetry is still present even in this system.

#### Remark 2.2.2

In matching coloured systems with Hecke algebras, sometimes we may identify color $j$ with element $j$, and sometimes identify color $j$ with element $N+1-j$. This is not an essential difference, and the importance here is that the swapping rules are different and depend on the order of the elements.
