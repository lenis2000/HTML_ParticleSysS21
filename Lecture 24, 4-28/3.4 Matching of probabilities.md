Here we use [[3.2 Color-position symmetry#Theorem 3 2 1 in the grid form|the previous theorem]] to prove a part of Borodin-Wheeler's colour matching result. Recall the result

#### Distribution matching

The probability in the coloured model

Is equal to the following probability in the uncoloured model:

#### Proof of the distribution matching for empty I

Turns out that the Hecke approach allows to easily prove the above equality of probabilities, but for the particular case $I=\varnothing$. Note that this was the case we used for the second class particles.

Now we can apply the involution, and get
