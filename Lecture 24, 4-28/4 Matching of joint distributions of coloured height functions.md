Let us now begin discussing height functions in coloured models

In the usual uncoloured case, recall that we have

Let us add colours, and define

#### Definition 4.0.1

Let $H_k(M,N)$ be the height function for colours $\ge k$, that is, the number of paths of colour $\le k$ that exit through the right boundary. 

#### Lemma 4.0.2 + proof

We have an easy matching between (single-point) distributions of coloured and uncoloured height functions:

Let us prove that this extends to multiple colours. 

#### Theorem 4.0.3

#### Proof 4.0.3

We have

Now apply the involution:

This discusion readily extends to the general case.
