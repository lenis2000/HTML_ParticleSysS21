In the stochastic six vertex model, R matrices (which are stochastic operators in $V\otimes V$, $\dim V=n+1$ for the $n$-colored model) behave "like" elements of the Hecke algebra.

It is very natural to ask whether they satisfy some quadratic relation similar to the one satisfied by the $T_s$'s. In fact, the $Y_{s,x}$ also satisfy a certain quadratic relation. 

We will give an example for 2 colors, when $R$ is an $9\times 9$ matrix. 

Recall the weights in the stochastic six vertex model.

Let the $R$ matrix be the one with a swap in the target space $V\otimes V$ (which interchanges the tensor factors). That is, the following matrix is made up of the weights $w(i_1,j_1;j_2,i_2)$:

One can check:

#### Proposition 3.1.1

The twisted R matrix satisfies the following quadratic relation

(where $Id$ is the identity matrix)

This is shown for $2$ colors. See [[Problems, 4-28#2|Problem 2]] for a hint in the general case. 

Therefore, 

#### Proposition 3.1.2

We may identify the R matrix with the Hecke element $R=Y_{s,x}=x T_s+(1-x)$, for a suitable $x$. 

So, we can build the stochastic coloured six vertex model as a result of an application of a product of the $Y$ elements to the identity permutation.

Then 

#### Lemma 3.1.3

This application produces a vertex model in the $(k+1)\times (b-a+1)$ box.
