#### Example 3.3.2. Bernoulli shift

Let us discuss this example in more detail. Here $\mathsf{P}$, the probability measure, which corresponds to tossing a fair coin infinitely many times.

The preimage is

Note that for this map, it is not true that $\mathsf{P}(TA)=\mathsf{P}(A)$ for all $A$. Indeed, if $A=\left\{ x_1=0 \right\}$, then $TA$ is the whole space $\Omega$.

In the Venn diagram form, the map $T$ looks as

[[Problems, 2-8|Problems 4-6]] discuss measure-preserving maps and ergodicity a little further.

#### Theorem 3.3.3. Subadditive ergodic theorem (in superadditive form)

We are giving this theorem in a superadditive form so that it's easier to apply later to last-passage percolation.

Let $g_n(x)$, $x\in \Omega$, be a sequence of integrable functions which satisfy superadditivity:
$$
g_{n+m}(x)\ge g_n(x)+g_m(T^nx),\qquad \forall x\in \Omega.
$$
Then
1. Almost surely (i.e., for $\mathsf{P}$-almost every $x$) there exists a limit
$$
g(x)=\lim_{n\to+\infty}\frac{g_n(x)}{n},
$$
which is $\le +\infty$.
2. The limiting function is invariant, i.e., $g(Tx)=g(x)$ for $\mathsf{P}$-almost every $x\in \Omega$.

#### Proof 3.3.3

We leave the proof of this result out of this course. However, you are welcome to give a 10-minute talk on this proof. See [[Problems, 2-8#T1|Assignment T1]] and let me know if you're interested.
