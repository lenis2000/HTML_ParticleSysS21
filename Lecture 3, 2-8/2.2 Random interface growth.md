The model of random interface growth is a **more efficient** way of running TASEP, as there are no "lost" events in the governing Poisson process, like it was in the [[../Lecture 2, 2-3/2.2 Existence of TASEP|Harris graphic construction]].

In the growth model, each cell $(i,j)$ of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is equipped with an independent exponential random variable $\alpha_{i,j}\sim\mathrm{Exp}(1)$ (with mean $1$). When the interface reaches $(i,j)$ and $(i,j)$ becomes the corner of the unoccupied zone, then the interface waits time $\alpha_{i,j}$ and after that covers the cell $(i,j)$.
