We take weights $\alpha_{i,j}\ge0$ in the environment, where the weights are:

1. Independent identically distributed
2. Nonnegative
3. Have enough moments, i.e., $\mathbb{E}|\alpha_{i,j}|^{r}<\infty$ for large enough $r$.

Recall the definition of the point-to-point last-passage time $L(x,y)$, $x,y\in \mathbb{Z}^2$. 

#### Remark 3.1.1

Unless $x=(x_1,x_2),y=(y_1,y_2)$ are in the "up-right position" ($x_1\le y_1$ and $x_2\le y_2$), then clearly $L(x,y)=0$.

#### Definition 3.1.2. Percolation time along a vector

Pick a unit direction $\vec v\in \mathbb{R}^{2}_{\ge0}$, $|\vec v| = 1$. Define $L(0,n\vec v)$ to be the last-passage percolation time from $0$ to $n\vec v$.

#### Remark 3.1.3

Instead of $n\vec v$, we should take the integer part in both coordinates. This is always assumed throughout the lecture. Moreover, some proofs rely on $\vec v$ being a rational vector, and more care is needed when one wants to extend the limits to irrational $\vec v$'s. Especially this is important when considering invariance under translations by $\vec v$. I am not touching these issues for simplicity of the discussion, and refer to Timo Seppalainen's notes (see [[_Lecture 3, 2-8#Notes and references|ref 3]]) for a more careful analysis.

#### Proposition 3.1.4

As a function of $n$, the quantities $L(0,n\vec v)$ satisfy **superadditivity**:
$$
L(0,n\vec v)\ge L(0, m\vec v)+L(m\vec v,n\vec v),\qquad m\le n.
$$

#### Proof 3.1.4

The left-hand side maximizes over a larger set of up-right paths.

#### Definition 3.1.5

Now take the averages, and define the following nonrandom quantities: $T(n)=\mathbb{E}\,L(0,n \vec v)$. Then
$T(n)\ge T(m)+T(n-m)$. Indeed, because the iid environment $(\alpha_{i,j})$ is translation-invariant, the expectation of $L(m\vec v,n\vec v)$ is the same as $T(n-m)$.

Thus, the nonrandom sequence $T(n)$ satisfies superadditivity.

#### Definition 3.1.6

A sequence $(a_n)$ is called **superadditive**, if $a_{m+n}\ge a_m+a_n$ for all $m,n$.

A sequence $(a_n)$ is called **subadditive**, if $a_{m+n}\le a_m+a_n$ for all $m,n$.

#### Remark 3.1.7

Subadditivity and superadditivity are essentially equivalent (take negation of all the elements of the sequence). In last-passage percolation we need _superadditivity_, but the convergence result we need is traditionally called _subadditive ergodic theorem_.
