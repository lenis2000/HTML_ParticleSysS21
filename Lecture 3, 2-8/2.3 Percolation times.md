Let $L_{i,j}\in \mathbb{R}$ be a random variable representing the time $t$ at which the growing interface $h_t$ covers $(i,j)$. Clearly, $L_{i,j}$ depend on the initial condition, the initial interface $h_0$. 

We have $L_{i,j}\ge L_{i-1,j}$, $L_{i,j}\ge L_{i,j-1}$.

#### Proposition 2.3.1

![[../img/Pasted image 20210208213223.png]]

This immediately follows from definitions.

#### Corollary 2.3.2

The space covered by $h_t$ at time $t$ is $\left\{ (i,j)\colon L_{i,j}\le t \right\}$.

#### Corollary 2.3.3

This interpretation explains the name **oriented (= directed) last-passage percolation**. 

#### Proof 2.3.3

Show that the right-hand side (maximum of sums) satisfies the same recursion as the $L_{i,j}$'s in [[2.3 Percolation times#Proposition 2 3 1|proposition]].

#### Remark 2.3.4

In [[2.3 Percolation times#Corollary 2 3 3|Corollary 2.3.3]], the paths $\pi$ start at the initial interface $h_0$ and ends at $(i,j)$. Note that when $h_0$ has a straight part, the path must start at the corner of the initial interface - we cannot start the growth from the middle of a straight part.

#### Remark 2.3.5

There is also first-passage percolation (FPP), in which $\max$ is replaces by $\min$. Moreover, by first-passage percolation people usually mean the undirected process, i.e., we do not restrict minimization to directed paths but rather look at paths of certain length $\le n$. Although the FPP model is related, it is usually not integrable.
