We have the $t$-Laplace transform for the height function of the (inhomogeneous) stochastic six vertex model:

We expect the $t$-Laplace transform to converge to a Fredholm determinant (which expresses the Tracy-Widom distribution).

We would like to rewrite the $t$-Laplace transform as a Fredholm determinant. We have $k$-fold nested contour integral expressions for the $k$-th moment:

We would like to have a determinant under the **non-nested** $k$-fold integral. How about getting the determinant?
