#### 2.5.1. Proof.

The proof proceeds by a careful bookkeeping of residues and substitutions occurring during contour deformations.

Each time we pick either a residue, or an integral.

We regard this as a function of the remaining free variables $z_{i_{\lambda_1}},z_{j_{\lambda_2}}$, and so on.

##### Step 1.

##### Step 2.

That is, instead of calling the free variables $z_{i_{\lambda_1}},z_{j_{\lambda_2}},\ldots$, which remembers the structure of the original integral, we will define a "canonical" way to encode residues.

Therefore, for a fixed $\lambda$ the sum over $I$:

equals

##### Step 3. 

Now we can separate the part of the formula which needs a residue, and part which is symmetrized.

For symmetrization we have

See [[../Lecture 17, 4-5/Problems, 4-5#2|this problem]].

##### Step 4.

For the residue, one can explicitly compute it:

We're now checking that the powers of $t$ agree:

This completes the proof of the theorem.
