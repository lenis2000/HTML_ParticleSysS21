# Notes and references

There are several papers on the method of $t$- (or $q$-) moments in the analysis of interacting particle systems. Here are the main references:

4. Alexey Bufetov, Matteo Mucciconi, Leonid Petrov. Yang-Baxter random fields and stochastic vertex models. https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06815. Section 9.1 discusses operator approach to getting $t$-moments of the stochastic six vertex model, and the corresponding Fredholm determinants.
