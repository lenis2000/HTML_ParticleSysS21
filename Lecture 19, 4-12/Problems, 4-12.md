# 2

Compute the residue of the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)=\int_0^\infty t^{x-1}e^{-t}dt$ at nonpositive integers $-n$, $n=0,1,2\ldots$. The Gamma function is not defined there by this formula, but rather one could use the reflection formula for the Gamma function:
$$
\Gamma(x)\Gamma(1-x)=\frac{\pi}{\sin(\pi x)}, \qquad x\notin \mathbb{Z}.
$$
