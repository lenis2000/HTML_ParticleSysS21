There is an equivalent description of the Gibbs property using so-called harmonic functions. 

#### Definition 3.2.1

Let $\lambda\in GT_N$. By $\mathrm{Dim}_N\lambda$ denote the number of interlacing arrays of depth $N$ with top row $\lambda$. 

For example, $\mathrm{Dim}_3(4,1,1)=10$.

See [[Problems, 2-22#5|Problem 5]].

In fact, $\mathrm{Dim}_N\lambda$ is the dimension of the irreducible representation of $U(N)$ corresponding to $\lambda$.

#### Definition 3.2.2

Let $M$ be a Gibbs measure on infinite interlacing arrays. Associate to it a family of functions on $GT_N$ for each $N$, by
$$
\varphi_N(\lambda)=\frac{M(\lambda^{(N)}=\lambda)}{\mathrm{Dim}_N\lambda}.
$$
For a Gibbs measure this is the same as $M(\lambda^{(1)}=\mu,\ldots,\lambda^{(N-1)}=\nu,\lambda^{(N)}=\lambda )$ for any fixed interlacing array $(\mu,\ldots,\nu,\lambda )$ of depth $N$ with top row $\lambda$. In this equivalent description we use the Gibbs property in an essential way, as an independence from the lower rows $\mu,\ldots,\nu $.

#### Proposition 3.2.3

The space of Gibbs measures on infinite interlacing arrays is in a one-to-one correspondence with the space of harmonic functions $\left\{ \varphi_N \right\}$, that is, which satisfy
$$
\varphi_N(\lambda)=\sum_{\nu\in GT_{N+1}}\varphi_{N+1}(\nu)
$$
for all $N$ and all $\lambda\in GT_N$.

#### Proof 3.2.3

For any measure $M$ on infinite interlacing arrays we have

If the measure is Gibbs, we immediately get the harmonicity of $\varphi_N$ defined by $\varphi_N(\lambda)=M(\lambda^{(N)}=\lambda)/\mathrm{Dim}_N\lambda$.

On the other hand, if the functions $\varphi_N(\lambda)$ are harmonic, let us define a measure $M$ using $\varphi_N$'s and the Gibbs property:
$$
M(\lambda^{(1)}=\mu,\ldots,\lambda^{(N-1)}=\varkappa,\lambda^{(N)}=\lambda ):=\varphi_N(\lambda),
$$
independently of $\mu,\ldots,\varkappa$. This measure is automatically Gibbs, and the measure $M$ is well-defined thanks to the harmonicity condition.$\qquad \square$
