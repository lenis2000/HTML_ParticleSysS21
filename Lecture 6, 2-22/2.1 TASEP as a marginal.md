It is known that a function of a Markov process is not necessarily a Markov process itself. Indeed, if a function is not one-to-one, it could "forget" some information.

However, we can see that TASEP is represented as a function of the push-block dynamics, and moreover it is marginally Markovian.

#### Theorem 2.1.1

Let $x_k=\lambda^{(k)}_k-k$, where $\left\{ \lambda^{(k)}_j \right\}$ is an interlacing array evolving as a push-block process. Then $\left\{ x_k \right\}$ evolves as TASEP.

#### Proof 2.1.1

This follows in a straightforward way from the definition of the push-block process. Here is an example of the mapping:
