1. Push-block process was introduced in ```A. Borodin and P. Ferrari. Anisotropic growth of random surfaces in 2+1 dimensions. Commun. Math. Phys., 325:603–684, 2014```. [arXiv:0804.3035 [math-ph]](https://arxiv.org/abs/0804.3035).
2. A simulation of the push-block process due to P.Ferrari can be found [here](https://wt.iam.uni-bonn.de/ferrari/research/jsanimationakpz).
3. The problem of classification of extreme Gibbs measures on tilings of the upper half plane has a long history. For example, see ```A. Borodin and G. Olshanski. The boundary of the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph: A new approach. Adv. Math., 230:1738–1779, 2012```. [arXiv:1109.1412 [math.CO]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1412).
