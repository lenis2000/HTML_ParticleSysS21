#### Definition 3.1.1

Let $N$ be fixed. An **extreme Gibbs measure** on interlacing arrays $\lambda^{(1)}\prec \ldots\prec \lambda^{(N)} $ of depth $N$ is a probability measure on these arrays, under which $\lambda^{(N)}$ is fixed, and the joint distribution of 
$$
\lambda^{(1)}\prec \ldots\prec \lambda^{(N-1)} 
$$
is _uniform_ on the set of interlacing arrays of depth $N$ with fixed top row $\lambda^{(N)}$.

In other words, extreme Gibbs measures of finite depth are just uniform measures.

#### Example 3.1.2

If $N=3$ and $\lambda^{(3)}=(4,1,1)$, then the corresponding extreme Gibbs measure places probability weight $\frac{1}{10}$ onto each of the $10$ arrays:

#### Definition 3.1.3

A **Gibbs measure** on interlacing arrays $\lambda^{(1)}\prec \ldots\prec \lambda^{(N)}$ of depth $N$ is a probability measure on these arrays which is a mixture (=~convex combination of extreme ones).

In other words, conditioned on $\lambda^{(N)}=\lambda$, the conditional distribution of all the lower rows $\lambda^{(1)},\ldots,\lambda^{(N-1)}$ is uniform among all interlacing arrays with top row $\lambda^{(N)}$.

#### Definition 3.1.4

A measure $M$ on interlacing arrays of infinite depth is called **Gibbs**, if for every $N$, conditioned on $\lambda^{(N)}=\lambda$, the conditional distribution of the lower rows $\lambda^{(1)},\ldots,\lambda^{(N-1)} $ does not depend on the higher rows $\lambda$, and is uniform on the set of interlacing arrays with top row $\lambda$. That is,
$$
M\left( \lambda^{(1)},\ldots,\lambda^{(N-1)}\mid \lambda^{(N)}=\lambda  \right)=\frac{1}{\#\left\{ \text{interlacing arrays of depth $N$ with top row $\lambda$} \right\}}
$$

#### Example 3.1.5

The delta measure with $\lambda^{(k)}_j=0$ for all $1\le j\le k<+\infty$ is Gibbs for trivial reasons.

#### Example 3.1.6

Take $\beta\in(0,1)$ and a random walk. Place 0 everywhere to the left of the random walk, and $1$ everywhere to the right of it. Thus, we get a random interlacing array. In fact, this measure is Gibbs.
