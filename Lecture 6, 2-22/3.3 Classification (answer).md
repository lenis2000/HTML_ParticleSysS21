Recall that a Gibbs measure (on infinite interlacing arrays) is called **extreme** if it cannot be represented as a nontrivial convex combination of other such Gibbs measures.

The problem of classification of extreme Gibbs measures is solved, but its solution is very interesting and has lead to many developments. There are also several equivalent ways to formulate this problem, including a representation-theoretic one (classify all indecomposable normalized characters of the infinite-dimensional unitary group $U(\infty)$).


Let us mention the answer. The space of parameters of extreme measures is a certain subset $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{4\infty+2}$, and the mapping at the level of harmonic functions is as follows:
