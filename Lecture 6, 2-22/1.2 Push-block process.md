#### Definition 1.2.1

On $\mathcal{C}$, we define a continuous time Markov process as follows:

You may think that this dynamics preserves interlacing, and also under it the lower particles are heavier than the higher particles.

See also [[Problems, 2-22#2|Problem 2]].

#### Example 1.2.2

Here are a few transitions of the push-block process

#### Corollary 1.2.3

So, the asymptotic behaviour of the first particle is as follows, by the CLT:
