#### Definition 1.1.1.

GT stands for "Gelfand-Tsetlin". Elements of $GT_N$ are usually called **signatures**.

**Connection to representation theory**: $GT_N$ encodes irreducible representations of the unitary group $U(N)$. This is the group of complex $N\times N$ matrices $A$ such that $A^*A=Id$, where "$*$" is conjugate transpose. (This is the complex analogue of orthogonal matrices.)

#### Definition 1.1.3. Interlacing arrays

Let $\mathcal{C}\subset GT_1\times GT_2\times GT_3\times$ be the set of interlacing arrays, i.e., of sequences $\left\{ \lambda^{(k)}\in GT_k \right\}$ with the property that $\lambda^{(1)}\prec \lambda^{(2)}\prec \lambda^{(3)}\prec \ldots$. For example:

**Note.** Interlacing naturally appears in several contexts:
- roots of a polynomial and of its derivative;
- matrix spectra (this context is closer to us here). 

See [[Problems, 2-22#1|Problem 1]], for example.

#### Example 1.1.4. Lozenge tiling interpretation

There is a bijection of the set of interlacing arrays of a fixed depth $N$ to *lozenge tilings* of a strip of width $N$ with $N$ "defects" on top. Therefore, infinite interlacing arrays are in bijection with tilings of the upper half plane. Lozenges are three types of rhombi on the regular triangular grid.

For step 1, shift the coordinates so that they are distinct on each level:

Then draw vertical lozenges at these coordinates, in a coordinate system with $120^\circ$ angle between the axes:
