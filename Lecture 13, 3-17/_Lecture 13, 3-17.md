1. Correlation functions of Schur measures and processes via $q$-difference operators is a somewhat later addition to the theory, due to ```Amol Aggarwal. Correlation Functions of the Schur Process Through Macdonald Difference Operators```, https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6979
2. Other approaches to correlation functions are:
	- via fermionic operators in Okounkov's papers https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9907127, https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0107056
	- via linear algebra (manipulations with determinants) in Borodin-Rains https://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0409059
