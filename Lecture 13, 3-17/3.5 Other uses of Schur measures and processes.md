Beyond TASEP / push-block process, Schur measures and processes appear in a number of settings:

#### Plane partitions

We put "boxes" in the corner, and the probability of a configuration is $q^{\text{number of boxes}}$


#### Domino tilings

We tile this figure by dominoes $1\times 2$ or $2\times 1$.

#### Products of random matrices

In a limit, Schur measures describe the eigenvalue distribution of a spectrum of a product of random matrices.

See, for example, Borodin, Gorin and Strahov ([[_Lecture 13, 3-17#Notes and references|refs]]).
