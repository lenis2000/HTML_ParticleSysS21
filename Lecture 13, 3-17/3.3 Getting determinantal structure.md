Let us look at the previous formula. Everything not highlighted in red depends on $z_\alpha,w_\alpha$ in a product form! Moreover, in the highlighted part we can recognize a **determinant!**

We employ the Cauchy determinant that we proved earlier ([[../Lecture 8, 3-1/4.2 Proof via determinants#Lemma 4 2 2 Cauchy determinant|here]]):

#### Theorem 3.3.1

For the general Schur measure we have determinantal correlations:

#### Proof 3.3.1

Terms highlighted in light blue have product form:

So we can put them inside the determinant, and get:
$$
\Large\det\left[ \frac{f_\alpha(z_\alpha)g_\beta(w_\beta)}{w_\beta-z_\alpha} \right]_{i,j=1}^m.
$$
Then, one readily sees that the $2m$-fold integral of a determinant is the same as the determinant of double integrals. This completes the proof.
