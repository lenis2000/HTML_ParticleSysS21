We're going to work with Schur measures with general parameters $\vec x,\vec y$.

Recall that the application of a single operator $D_q$ in the $\vec x$ variables produces:

Now we apply two such operators:

We observe that before the application of the second operator we have the dependence on the variables $x_i$ in a product form.

Let us observe a general fact:

#### Lemma 3.1.1

For nice $f$ which is holomorphic inside the integration contour and does not have any poles/zeros at $x_i,qx_i$, we have:

#### Proof 3.1.1

The proof repeats [[../Lecture 11, 3-10/2.1 Expectation via q-difference operators#Proof 2 1 2|Proof of L11 - Proposition 2.1.1]], almost exactly.

Now let us use this lemma to apply the second operator. We get:

#### Lemma 3.1.2

Note: The yellow boxed formula is something which did not appear in the density function, but it comes from $g(q_2 w)/g(w)$, for $g(w)=\dfrac{q_1z-w}{z_1-w}$.

Now let us generalize to many operators. The proof of that is straightforward:

#### Proposition 3.1.3
