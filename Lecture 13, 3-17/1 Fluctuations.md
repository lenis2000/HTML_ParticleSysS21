Recall that we have shown the following for TASEP, started from the step initial configuration:
$$
x_{\lfloor cN \rfloor }(\tau N)=N\left( \tau-2\sqrt{\tau c} \right)+o(N).
$$
Our next objective is to get a handle on the fluctuations $o(N)$.

We recall that
$$
x_N(t)\stackrel{d}{=}\lambda_N-N,\qquad 
\lambda=(\lambda_1\ge \ldots\ge \lambda_N\ge0 )\sim SM_{(1,\ldots,1 ;\rho_t)}.
$$

The main property of the Schur measures which is of interest to us is their **determinantal structure**. More precisely, we will show today that the random subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ defined as 
$$
\mathcal{S}=\left\{ \lambda_1+N-1,\lambda_2+N-2,\ldots,\lambda_{N-1}+1,\lambda_N  \right\}
$$
forms a determinantal point process.
