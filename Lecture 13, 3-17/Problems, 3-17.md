could define a point process:
1. Show that it is positive definite, that is, all diagonal minors $\det[K(x_i,x_j)]_{i,j=1}^m$ are nonnegative. 
2. Show that these minors are at most one. Hint: here you can use the complementation principle and pass from $K$ to $\mathbf{1}-K$.

# 2

Is the determinantal kernel $K(a,b)$ for the Schur measure Hermitean symmetric?
